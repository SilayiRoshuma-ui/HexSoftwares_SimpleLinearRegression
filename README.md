# Simple Linear Regression – Housing Price Prediction

## Internship Program
HexSoftwares Data Science Internship

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Simple Linear Regression model
using Python. The goal is to predict a target variable (house price equivalent)
based on selected features using a supervised learning approach.

## Dataset
- Built-in Diabetes dataset from scikit-learn
- Target variable renamed as PRICE for regression purposes
- Dataset is clean with no missing values

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Steps Performed
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data visualization using correlation heatmap
3. Feature selection
4. Train-test split
5. Model training using Linear Regression
6. Model evaluation using MSE and R² Score
7. Visualization of Actual vs Predicted values

## Results
- The model achieved a reasonable R² score
- The results show a positive relationship between selected features and the target variable

## Conclusion
This project provided hands-on experience in data preprocessing, regression modeling,
and performance evaluation, strengthening core data science skills.
